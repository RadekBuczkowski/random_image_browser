# Random Image Browser &nbsp; ![Icon](src/Resources/butterfly.ico?raw=true)

### Description

This is a browser for images with smooth animations and fluid repeated scrolling like on an iPhone. It shows several images one one page and you can zoom in each image with a mouse click.

All image transitions like zooming, navigation, rotations, changing image arrangements, etc. **are animated**. The browser can group images and shulffle the groups (default) or can show all images in random order.

By default the following image types are enabled in the options:
**jpg, jpeg, gif, png, webp, avif**.
But after starting the application you can easily enable other less common image extensions in the program Options.

The browser is currently available in 3 languages (**English, Danish and German**). The default language is specified
in the operating system, but it is possible change it in the configuration.

### Compiled version

The compiled version of the application is available as a ClickOnce installation [at this link](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RadekBuczkowski/random_image_browser/main/ClickOnce/Publish.html).

ClickOnce gives you automatic updates when starting the application. Please note that the ClickOnce installation does not have certificates attached
(the cost for a certificate is 300$ per year) so you have to ignore all warnings about an untrusted provider.

The compiled version of the application is also available as a tar.gz file and can be downloaded [from this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RadekBuczkowski/random_image_browser/main/publish/RandomImageBrowser.tar.gz). Simply copy the content to a folder, no installation needed.

## Performance

The application uses the graphic card extensively. If you want to improve performance and smoothness, close other application using the graphic card, 
especially Web browsers. When the application becomes less fluid, you can always press F4 to restart (it keeps the state of the images unchanged) and remedy the problem. There is also an option to automatically restart after viewing a certain number of images.

### Screen-shots

The program is rich in options and configurations and is very easy to use. Below are a few of the configuratons.
